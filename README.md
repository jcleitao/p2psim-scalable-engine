# p2psim-scalable-engine

This project contains variants of the scalable event-drive engine for the Peernet simulator (https://github.com/jcleitao/p2psim-core).

This allows to run large-scale experiments where the total number of events to be processed by the simulator grow beyond the maximum size of an Integer. Furthermore, we provide a variant of the simulation engine that relies on parallel execution of the experiment without compromising the deterministic nature of these experiments.

This project is being conducted by the NOVA-SYS research group (https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/) of the NOVA LINCS laboratory (https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/) from the NOVA School of Science and Technology (https://www.fct.unl.pt/en/about-fct/overview) in Portugal.

This iniative is being pursued in colaboration with Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai/), in particular with the ResNet Lab (https://research.protocol.ai/groups/resnetlab/).
